Class \hyperlink{classsolar__core_1_1_household}{solar\+\_\+core\+:\+:Household} ]Once survey is completed will have data\+: what are your choices and decisions on solar panels. The same logic as in \hyperlink{classsolar__core_1_1_s_e_i}{S\+E\+I}. Hidden parameter/factor is utility of accepting project. Might be more complex to estimate as will have a lot of categorical data.

Class \hyperlink{classsolar__core_1_1_s_e_i}{solar\+\_\+core\+:\+:S\+E\+I} ]For choice function could try neural nets -\/ train them, include two sets of parameters, one will be parameters of an installer and the second will be parameters of a project. The resulting node will be probability of accepting project. Estimation will be done on a database with all installed solar panels. It is equivalent to density estimation using N\+N. Could also use P\+C\+A when the estimated component is assumed to be profit from the project. Could use Python with sci-\/kit or check Tensor\+Flow. Once estimation is done -\/ could use it as a simple linear function to produce estimation of profit -\/ and thus estimation for the chance of accepting project. Basically dataset will produce profit estimation in some form, should still work even if have only accepted projects. For new project -\/ will get profit estimation.

Class \hyperlink{classsolar__core_1_1_world_map}{solar\+\_\+core\+:\+:World\+Map} ]generally have 2-\/d grid for spacial information, but it might be too much for the number of agents. Might need to compress or block representation. 10$^\wedge$5 = 10$^\wedge$3 $\ast$ 10$^\wedge$3. Might need grid with sizes, each lot has a size. 10$^\wedge$3 for rows and columns is O\+K size.
