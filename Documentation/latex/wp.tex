The same logic as in \hyperlink{classsolar__core_1_1_s_e_i}{S\+E\+I}. Hidden parameter/factor is utility of accepting project. Might be more complex to estimate as will have a lot of categorical data.

The resulting node will be probability of accepting project. Estimation will be done on a database with all installed solar panels. It is equivalent to density estimation using N\+N. Could also use P\+C\+A when the estimated component is assumed to be profit from the project. Could use Python with sci-\/kit or check Tensor\+Flow. Once estimation is done -\/ could use it as a simple linear function to produce estimation of profit -\/ and thus estimation for the chance of accepting project. Basically dataset will produce profit estimation in some form, should still work even if have only accepted projects. For new project -\/ will get profit estimation.
