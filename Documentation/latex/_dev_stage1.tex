If decide to use in the next stage might have to add field to indicate from what stage of quoting this message is. Alternative is to have separate classes for different quotes from different stages. Actually like it more. Need to have base message class to avoid multiple containers for them. But at the same time it might be actually more efficient to have multiple containers for different stages of quoting. It will make search and compare much quicker...
