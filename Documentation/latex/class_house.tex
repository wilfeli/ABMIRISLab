\subsection{Detailed Description}
M\+A\+R\+K\+: generally have 2-\/d grid for spacial information, but it might be too much for the number of agents. Might need to compress or block representation. 10$^\wedge$5 = 10$^\wedge$3 $\ast$ 10$^\wedge$3. Might need grid with sizes, each lot has a size. 10$^\wedge$3 for rows and columns is O\+K size.

Will have patches of houses, each house -\/ 1 tile with size. Also will have empty tiles with sizes also. Will decrease total number of tiles. Will have neighborhoods with different tile sizes, house characteristics, population density as a derivative of tile size.

Belongs to Household.
