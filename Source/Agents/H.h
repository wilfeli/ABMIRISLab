 Has multiple humans, but they are not modelled as decision agents only the HH is the decision making agent.
 
 
 @wp Once survey is completed will have data: what are your choices and decisions on solar panels. The same logic as in SEI. Hidden parameter/factor is utility of accepting project. Might be more complex to estimate as will have a lot of categorical data.
 
 @DevStage3 think about using http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/result_of - very neat construction
