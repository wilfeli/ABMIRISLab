 @wp generally have 2-d grid for spacial information, but it might be too much for the number of agents. Might need to compress or block representation. 10^5 = 10^3 * 10^3. Might need grid with sizes, each lot has a size. 10^3 for rows and columns is OK size.
 
 Will have patches of houses, each house - 1 tile with size. Also will have empty tiles with sizes also. Will decrease total number of tiles. Will have neighborhoods with different tile sizes, house characteristics, population density as a derivative of tile size.
